Goals:
1) detect filesystem volume has 
2) extract metadata  

minimum error checking 

Phase 2:
2 parameters per command line: 1) operation (in this case, /find) 2)binary file with disk volume 3) file
eg:
./shooter <operation> <volume> <filename>

Goals:
1) find the file in the root directory of the system and display its size (the (filename))

Phase 3:
we don't care about indirect data blocks 
Ext2 is the same as the current implementation, but slightly different

Goals:
1) just like phase 2, except we want to find a file in any directory

Phase 4:

Goals:
1) find and delete requested file
