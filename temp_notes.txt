Goals:
1) detect filesystem volume has 
2) extract metadata  

minimum error checking 

Phase 2:
2 parameters per command line: 1) operation (in this case, /find) 2)binary file with disk volume 3) file
eg:
./shooter <operation> <volume> <filename>

Goals:
1) find the file in the root directory of the system and display its size (the (filename))

Ext2
we need to use inodes to get some certain information
Every volume is split in block groups
every x bytes, there's a block group (fixed size)
each block has a specific pattern of information in it
We have to read the info from the super block
group descriptors --> tells you where each part of the information in the block is
then you need to go to the inode table, and the split up the information 
first inode is the same for each block 
inode 11 is only on the first block --> blockgroup 0

Phase 3:

Goals:
1) just like phase 2, except we want to find a file in any directory

Phase 4:

Goals:
1) find and delete requested file
